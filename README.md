# TechValens-Intern
Flow:
  Install Anaconda / Jupyter
  Explore datasets (e.g., Iris, Titanic)
  Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) using pandas and seaborn
  GitHub practice (push code, write README)

  Theory you can read side by side:
  What is AI, ML, DL, Data Science?
  Types of ML: Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement
  ML Workflow Overview
  Python libraries for ML
  Data preprocessing basics

  Regression: Linear, Polynomial
  Classification: Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree
  Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix

  Activities:
  Build models on Titanic/Diabetes datasets
  Train/test split and cross-validation
  Use evaluation metrics to assess models
  Visualize decision boundaries

  Objective:
  Learn clustering, dimensionality reduction, and basics of neural networks.
  Topics:
  Clustering: K-means, Hierarchical
  PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
  Intro to Neural Networks
  TensorFlow/Keras basics
  Tools:
  scikit-learn
  TensorFlow/Keras (basic use)
  Activities:
  Cluster customers or mall data
  Visualize PCA and clusters
  Build a simple neural network on MNIST dataset (optional/bonus)
