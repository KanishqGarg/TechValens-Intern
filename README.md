# TechValens-Intern
Flow:
  Install Anaconda / Jupyter
  Explore datasets (e.g., Iris, Titanic)
  Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) using pandas and seaborn
  GitHub practice (push code, write README)

  Theory you can read side by side:
  What is AI, ML, DL, Data Science?
  Types of ML: Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement
  ML Workflow Overview
  Python libraries for ML
  Data preprocessing basics

  Regression: Linear, Polynomial
  Classification: Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree
  Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix

  Activities:
  Build models on the Titanic/Diabetes datasets
  Train/test split and cross-validation
  Use evaluation metrics to assess models
  Visualize decision boundaries

  Objective:
  Learn clustering, dimensionality reduction, and the basics of neural networks.
  Topics:
  Clustering: K-means, Hierarchical
  PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
  Intro to Neural Networks
  TensorFlow/Keras basics
  Tools:
  scikit-learn
  TensorFlow/Keras (basic use)
  Activities:
  Cluster customers or mall data
  Visualize PCA and clusters
  Build a simple neural network on the MNIST dataset (optional/bonus)

  Project Ideas:
  Predict house prices: https://github.com/KanishqGarg/House_price-prediction
  
  Customer churn prediction: https://github.com/KanishqGarg/Customer_Churn_Detection
  
  Email spam detection: https://github.com/KanishqGarg/Email_Fraud_Detection
  
  Sentiment analysis on tweets : https://github.com/KanishqGarg/Tweet_sentiment_analysis

  ChatBot using Intent Mapping: https://github.com/KanishqGarg/Chatbot_Intent
  used logistic regression to map questions to tags and then respond accordingly from the intent file
  
  NLP: preprocessed text using TextBlob, nltk, and spacy libraries to correct spelling, remove punctuations, lemmatization, and stemming, tokenized text into sentences and words, Performed Sentiment analysis using   libraries like VaderSentiment, TextBlob, sentiment analyzer, made a text summarizer model using pytestrank library, also performed NER(Named Entity Recognition) using spacy 
  Made a text paraphrasing detector using Spacy text similarity function, all-MiniLM-L6-v2 Sentence transformer preprocessed using TextBlob, nltk and spacy 

  LLMs: Made a character identity ChatBot user can input a book PDF and a character he wants the bot to chat like, and the bot responds to questions accordingly. Made using langchain with gemini API, used chroma vectorbase and vectorized book pdf, and using word embedding, embedded it into vector base, and then implemented RAG (retrieval augmented generation) on the pre-trained LLM 

  Made an image label and classification model using HuggingFace Transformer 

  Made an object detection model using Yolo5s and made a face detection model using a cascade classifier using a pre-trained model. Also made a face detection model by extracting HOG features and training it using a Neural Network
Implemented a Speech transcription and TTS generation model using speechrecognition and gTTS libraries

Built a face expression/emotion detection model using FER and OpenCV library from a image as well as a video input
